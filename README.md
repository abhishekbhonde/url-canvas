## 💡 Idea

This is a small sample project that demonstrates a powerful concept:
**application state can be fully stored inside the URL itself.**

Instead of using a backend or database, the entire data structure is encoded into the URL hash using Base64.
This means the app becomes:

* **Backend-free**
* **Shareable through a single link**
* **Permanently saved through bookmarking**
* **Zero-cost and offline-friendly**
* **Private, since nothing leaves the browser**

The same pattern can be applied to many useful tools—todo lists, notes, polls, configuration builders, whiteboards, small games, or any micro-app that normally requires storage.
